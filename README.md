<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>North South University is one the largest private university of Bangladesh with more than 26,000 students currently enrolled. NSU RDS or Student Portal which is the platform on which students can do their official activities such as Course Enrollment, Degree Application, Checking their results and student status, Course Registration Fees payment, and other payments for various documents.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>NSU RDS works perfect when it is logged in through desktop platforms. The problem is created when students try to do their work through mobile devices, such as Smartphones and Tablets. Some features donâ€™t work perfectly during the course registration phase. And sometimes students also face crashes in their mobile devices, which would not have happened if they tried it from a desktop platform.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT IDEA</strong></p>
The main idea of the project is to create a modernized standalone mobile application version of the RDS which will be in sync with the Web Version one, and problems that they faced before while using RDS from smartphones will be solved. As most of the time students tend to use smartphones to do all these things, it would be a great improvement if the Application can be done. 
<p><strong>TYPE OF PLATFORM</strong></p>
<p>For this project, I have decided to develop on Mobile Application Platform that is Android. Currently I am not focusing on iOS versions, but this can also be done. If the course instructor or the Administration allows me to.</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES & PHOTOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Landing Page/ Homepage</li>
<li>Student Profile- Name, CGPA, Credits Completed, Address etc</li>
<li>Advising Window</li>
<li>Grades</li>
<li>Payment Options</li>
<li>Attendance</li>
<li>Faculty Evaluation</li>
<li>Degree Analysis</li>
<li>Online Services</li>
<li>Course Drop</li>
<li>SMS History</li>
<li>Email Request</li>
<p>Rather than this, I want to add features like Frequently Asked Question, Tutorial Sections to use NSU Email, using Google Classroom, Student Support- to raise online tickets to solve their problems, also a feedback section which will be open to them for giving suggestions and report bugs as well which will be helpful to develop any further upgrades and new ideas.</p>
</ul>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>User Interface: User Interface has been hard coded using the base Android Studio XML editor.</p>
<p>Backend: Android Java, SQLite Database and Firebase</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEMS & DIFFICULTIES</strong></p>
<p>The project was first started on the upward model. That is, started with the backend coding. But could not proceed much as expected due to fewer knowledge in REST API. So, it was decided to start the project from scratch. Started with the simple login and sign up mechanism. There were some bugs found. For example, the Firebase system authentication was not working. The system would let in if one did not type in the wrong password and email. So fixed that. The last problem that was faced was .Homepage activity was in "NoActionBar" mode. So the app crashed everytime it went to the homepage section. As the logcat was not checked, it took a lot of time to figure that out. Finally as it was fixed there were no more errors and app crashes. </p>
<p><strong>MONETIZATION</strong></p>
<p>As this is a complete product of NSU, there is NO business plan associated with it. The owner of the codes and documentation will solely be NSU.</p>
